# Informal kickoff in Enschede

Present: Aron, Pablo R., Hongyang, Floriana

## Preparation

### Proposed agenda
By Aron Jansen.

1. A more detailed look at the data
2. A look at your current pipeline and how a potential deep learning model fits in
3. Discussing the approach to take

### Plan A

1. Train a U-Net on 2D, rootless simulations
2. Hope to generalize to 2D slices ofÂ  3D, rootless simulations
3. Hope to generalize to rootless 2D slices of experimental data
4. Hope to generalize to rooted 2D slices of experimental data

### Plan B

- Train an unsupervised model directly on the experimental data
