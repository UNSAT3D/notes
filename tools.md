- [ImageJ](https://imagej.net/)
    - Open source tool for visualising (3D) images, showing histograms of selected regions etc.
    - It's very easy to use: you can directly open the 3D scan .tif file, there is a bar below the image that scrolls through the horizontal slices, and under analyze->histogram you can create a histogram of the entire sample, or by clicking live and making a selection, of a smaller region.
